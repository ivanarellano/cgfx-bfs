BFS 2500

What's new?
+ DXT5_NM compression compatible. Uses high-quality normal recontruction that produces better results than uncompressed normal maps.

+ Binormal fix. Mirrored geometry correctly displays binormals.

+ Speed. The default technique will run without Parallax Occlusion Mapping for faster rendering. POM is available with the "Shader_Parallax" technique.
